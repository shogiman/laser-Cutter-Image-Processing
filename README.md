# laser-Cutter-Image-Processing
This is a series of files (both programs and images) I am using for use with a laser cutter I have access to

The conversion  of image files into **.dxf** files that I can use with a laser cutter requires some pre-processing of image files.  I primarily use **.png** files and any sripts I use tend to reference only those files, though with a little tweaking I am sure the scripts can be altered to accomodate other file formats.

Initially this repository shall contain the following types of files:
 * Python files for image processing
 * **.png** files that I have generated (for subsequent pre-processing)
 * **.dxf** files I have created, for importing into the laser cutter software (dongled to the machine in question)
